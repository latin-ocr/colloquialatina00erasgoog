THE favourable'reception which has been

accorded to Colloqaia Latino, published last
year, leads me to think that a second series of
dialogues may be found useful. As before, I have

allowed myself great freedom in the revision and
abbreviation of the text, in ordeon adapt these
‘little pictures' for school use. Iam more and
more impressed with Erasmus's wonderful oom-
. mand of the best Latin idiorn and vocabulary.
He is equally admirable in sparkling dialogue, in
graphio description, and in reflective' passages
· often of great beauty. With himLatin is indeed
a living language; and he seems to invest all his
themes with the charin of a perennial youthful-

ness.
